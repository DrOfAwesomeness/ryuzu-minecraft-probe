# RyuZU Minecraft Probe
This is a remote probe for some of the Minecraft cog functionality in [RyuZU-Bot2](https://github.com/crazybmanp/RyuZU-bot2). It's intended to run on a host alongside an unmodified Minecraft server, and exposes events (player joins and chat messages) from the log file to RyuZU through a RabbitMQ broker. It also allows the Minecraft cog to execute commands that depend on having a specific player connected without having to handle monitoring and retries on the RyuZU end (currently only the Minecraft `give` command, implemented through the probe's `reward` command, is supported).
